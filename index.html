<p>Welcome to my homepage! I am a high schooler interested in <b>math</b>, physics, and cs.
    I especially love math and want to take pure math as my major in college.</p>

<p> My favorite areas of math are geometry and number theory. 
    Besides math. I also like:
    <ul>
        <li>listening to J-POP, C-POP, rnb and diverse music</li>
        <li>playing random songs I have heard on the piano by my weak relative pitch <s>never perfect :pensive:</s></li>
        <li>playing badminton</li>
        <li>trying to livetex math lecture notes</li>
    </ul>
     
    I am the president of physics and math club in my school, teaching interesting content to make people love math and physics.
    Open-sourced handouts created by me (and my friends) are included in the <a href="resourcepage.html">resources</a> page.

<p>I started learning competitional math from a young age <s>even though I didn't really enjoy math at that time</s>. 
            However, my true love for math which is activated by my math teacher, began to arouse since grade 8.
            I previously planned to take domestic high school, but government's attitude towards events (i.e. COVID-19, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuzhou_chained_woman_incident">徐州铁链女事件 Xuzhou Chained Woman Incident</a>) changed my plan and influenced my life.
            Therefore, I started studying in international high school learning IB.</p>
            <p>I participated in the (amazing) <a href="https://rossprogram.org/" >Ross Mathematics Program</a> in 2023 as a first year in Indiana site, 
                furtherly strengthening my idea of taking math as my major.
                Some of my favorite moments in Ross includes:
            <ul>
                <li>doing problem sets until it is 2am,</li>
                <li>playing exploding kitten with friends in Percopo 002,</li>
                <li>5K run (even though I didn't finish it, my heart was beating so quickly),</li>
                <li>late night playing Mafia with all devices died during power outage,</li>
                <li>basement karaoke at 5am,</li>
                <li>knocking on friend's dorm door after lecture (bro you missed class!).</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the summer of 2024, I came back to Ross as a junior counselor of family 43. The experience was no doubt amazing! <s>And sadly, I became the one whose door often got smashed by family members because I overslept.</s> Everyone should apply to Ross (especially Indiana site). [See my reflections to <a href="writings/ross_reflection_23.html">Ross '23</a> and <a href="writings/ross_reflection_24.html">'24</a>]
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides my above interests, I am always attracted by fancy little cool stuffs like $\LaTeX$, typst, asymptote, manim, tikz... I am also interested in, as you can see, html and css. 
            </p>
            <p>By the way, my favorite formula is Euler's Identity, a special case of Euler's Formula $e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta + i\sin\theta$:
                \[e^{i\pi}+1=0\]

<h2>My Ambitious Dreams</h2>

<i>I have a dream, that I can read through all the UTM and GTM series. </i>

<h3>UTMs that I finished reading</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rational Points on Elliptic Curves - <i>John Tate and Joseph H. Silverman</i></li>
                <li>Linear Algebra Done Right - <i>Sheldon Axler</i></li>
            </ul>
            
<h3>GTMs that I finished reading</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography - <i>Neal Koblitz</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>I am currently reading</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A Conversational Introduction to Algebraic Number Theory: Arithmetic Beyond $\mathbb{Z}$ - <i>Paul Pollack</i></li>
</ul>

<!--This is the GTM part.-->
<h3>Modern Graph Theory</h3>
I took <a href="https://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">an interesting GTM Book Test</a> showing that if I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be ...

                I am an in-depth account of graph theory, written with the student in mind; 
                I reflect the current state of the subject and emphasize connections with other branches of pure mathematics.   
                Recognizing that graph theory is one of several courses competing for the attention of a student, I contain extensive descriptive passages designed to convey the flavor of the subject and to arouse interest.
