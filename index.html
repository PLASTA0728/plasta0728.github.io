<section id="body">
<p>Welcome to my homepage! I am a high schooler interested in <b>math</b>, physics, and cs.
    I especially love math and want to take pure math as my major in college.</p>

<p> My favorite areas of math are geometry and number theory. 
    Besides math I also like listening to classic and J-POP music and enjoy physics problem. 
    I am the president of physics and math club in my school, teaching interesting content to make people love math and physics.
    Open-sourced handouts created by me (and my friends) are included in the <a href="resourcepage.html">resources</a> page.

<p>I started learning competitional math from a young age, even though I didn't really enjoy math at that time. 
            However, my true love for math which is activated by my math teacher, began to arouse since grade 8.
            I previously planned to take domestic high school, but a few events (for example, COVID-19) changed my plan and influenced my life.
            Therefore, I started studying in international high school learning IB.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2023, I participated in the (amazing) <a href="https://rossprogram.org/" >Ross Mathematics Program</a>, 
                furtherly strengthening my idea of taking math as my major. <a href="Ross.html">(See my essay for Ross)</a>
                Some of my favorite moments in Ross includes:
            <ul>
                <li>Doing problem sets until it is 2am.</li>
                <li>Playing exploding kitten with friends in Percopo 002.</li>
                <li>5K run (even though I didn't finish it, my hreat was beating so quickly)</li>
                <li>Late night playing Mafia with all devices died during power outage.</li>
                <li>Basement karaoke at 5am.</li>
                <li>Knocking on friend's dorm door after lecture (bro you missed class!)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>By the way, my favorite formula is Euler's formula.
                \[
                e^{i\pi}+1=0
                \]

<h2>My Ambitious Dreams</h2>

<h3>UTMs ...</h3>
            <h4>that I finished reading</h4>

                I am an in-depth account of graph theory, written with the student in mind; 
                I reflect the current state of the subject and emphasize connections with other branches of pure mathematics.   
                Recognizing that graph theory is one of several courses competing for the attention of a student, I contain extensive descriptive passages designed to convey the flavor of the subject and to arouse interest.
