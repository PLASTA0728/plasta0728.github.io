    <p>
        I also like doing arts! I am interested in trying different kinds of art to reach 2 aims: 1) to reflect on myself 2) to record all sweet memories! Here are some of my <i>finished</i> artworks. <b>You can click on these pictures to see their titles and short introductions on a popup window (and close them by clicking somewhere else than the popup window).</b>
    </p>
    <p>I definitely love art? Though I don't have many artworks, as they are really time-consuming and sometimes in the middle I lost the passion which is why I have a bunch of sketches in my procreate. But exploring different things and media to express what I want to express is always something enjoyable! (I would like to say art is just like very difficult math problems &mdash; the moment you solved/finished it is the most enjoyable and when you are most proud of yourself, and looking back all efforts pay back. However, in the middle of the hard work I have to say it's tiring. But still, it's worth it!) Art also connects others with me closer!</p>

        <h2>ESPR Portrait</h2>
        <p>This piece was created as part of my “quest” challenge on the
            final day of ESPR '24. During the program, I reconnected with my
            passion for art—a passion that had quieted over time due to my
            focus on STEM and my hesitation about sharing my work. ESPR
            reignited my love for creating, bringing back an excitement I
            hadn't felt in a long time.</p>
        <p>As part of my challenge, I decided to make individual portraits for
            everyone in the camp. I designed the backgrounds with ESPR's
            theme colors, blue and yellow, using Python code to vary the
            brightness for each piece. The shifting backgrounds added an
            extra layer of difficulty in choosing the right skin tones, pushing my
            skills further in color selection. (Fun fact: while the quest was
            meant to be completed within 24 hours, it ended up taking me a
            bit longer—though in the time-lapse replay, it amusingly
            condensed to exactly 24 hours, 23 minutes, and 12 seconds!)</p>

        <h2>Hand (Real)</h2>
        <p>This sculpture is a smaller replica of my right hand, created as a
            reflection of my long struggle with skin allergies and a persistent
            habit of skin-picking developed from a young age, resulting in
            redder skin on parts of the palm and fingers captures the irritation,
            often covered with band-aids. This piece is a playful, self-aware
            commentary on the challenge of breaking a habit that has become
            a part of me.</p>

        <h2>Portrait for J</h2>
        <p>This portrait of my friend J was inspired by A, who created a
            portrait of her father as a birthday gift when we were in the Ross
            Program. I have sketched J's portrait twice from a reference
            photo, drawn to her elegant expression and graceful gesture. In
            my previous attempts, I refrained from adding color, fearing it
            might detract from the piece. However, this time I decided to
            embrace the challenge, resulting in significant improvement in my
            realistic painting skills. I am particularly pleased with how her hair
            turned out in this version.</p>

        <h2>Dream House</h2>
        <p>Inspired by learning about post-WWII to modern architecture, I
            was captivated by the elegance and order in structures made of
            glass, steel, and concrete. This model represents my vision of a
            modern-style dream house, created using SketchUp. The design
            includes a basement, a first and second floor, and a swimming
            pool. I also incorporated a sunken courtyard to connect the
            basement workspace with the outdoors, bringing natural light and
            an open feel to the design.</p>

        <h2>The Bridge</h2>
        <p>This artwork, titled The Bridge, features an original wooden stick
            structure paired with digital art. It represents the dualities of
            "Rationality" and "Emotionality," symbolizing the choices I face in
            my life. The inspiration for this piece came from my grandmother's
            illness. In the past, I often leaned heavily on rationality; however,
            in that challenging situation, I realized that pure analysis couldn't
            help her recover. Instead, by embracing the emotional side, I was
            able to provide much-needed support to my family and take
            responsibility for my role in the situation. This experience helped
            me find balance between rationality and emotionality, and now I
            find myself positioned between these two vital aspects of life.</p>

        <h2>Hand (Imaginary)</h2>
        <p>In contrast to Hand (Real), Hand (Imaginary) offers a different
            perspective on my injured hand. Though the injury itself isn’t
            pleasant, the act of skin-picking has become a release of stress
            and a way to calm myself. The green color across the injured area
            represents a “grassland”—a place of relaxation and relief from
            pressure. Meanwhile, the smooth, uninjured skin around it
            symbolizes stress that is not released by the bad habits:
            schoolwork, activities, GPA, research, and family responsibilities.
            This piece explores the complex interplay between relief and
            tension in my life.</p>

        <h2>Queen's Back Quad</h2>
        <p>This digital artwork was also created during the ESPR program,
            inspired by the positive feedback I received on my watercolor
            piece. I chose to sketch the scenery of the program venue,
            Queen's College, Oxford, using a Nikko Rull brush for its unique
            texture. In this piece, I challenged myself to prioritize color and
            overall atmosphere over precise structures, which I typically focus
            on. This shift allowed me to explore a more expressive approach,
            resulting in a piece that captures the vibrant vibes of the setting.</p>

        <h2>Mount Mogan</h2>
        <p>This piece was created during my travels in Mount Mogan, a place
            that holds special significance for me. Growing up in Huzhou, a
            small town nearby, I have always cherished the comfortable
            summer weather and the rich tapestry of traditional Chinese
            legends associated with Mount Mogan. This gouache painting is
            my first outdoor work with this medium, and it captures my deep
            appreciation for my roots.</p>
        <p>I feel a strong connection to Mount Mogan, as both it and I are
            linked to Shanghai—the mountain has long been a retreat for
            Shanghai elite (as noted on its Wikipedia page) even though it
            belongs to Huzhou. As a student at an international school in
            Shanghai who returns to Huzhou every weekend, I find a greater
            sense of belonging in my hometown, where life moves at a slower
            pace and the pressures are less intense. This artwork reflects my
            love for my native place and the tranquility it brings me.</p>
