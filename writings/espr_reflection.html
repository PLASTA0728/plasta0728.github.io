<h2>How have you been feeling so far? Oh, it has been <i>badass</i>... [Caution: informal]</h2>

<p>
The first time I got a note in my envelop for one-on-one, I opened it, hoping to see something very wholesome. And then, I saw "Hi I was your intro-er,
</p>
<p style="color: red;text-align: center;" >
You seem so <i>bad ass</i>..."
</p>
<p style="color: orange;text-align: center;" >
You seem so <i>bad ass</i>..."
</p>
<p style="color: blue;text-align: center;" >
You seem so <i>bad ass</i>..."
</p>

<p>
I was definitely frozen, feeling like I just been pushed into an express train to the north pole, or fell into an icehole with infinite depth. <i>What does it even mean by that "bad ass"??</i> Congrats! Gained the first hater on the second day of camp! Definitely something that I dreamed of for the whole half year after receiving the acceptance sent by ASPR! Panicking, I handed the message to Charmaine and asked "Do you know what it means by saying ur bad ass?? Is it something like asshole??" Thank god it is a positive word, though I have no idea why bad and ass can combine to be a positive word, maybe the operation is (negative*negative = positive), erm akshually here we use the multiplication instead of addition for word meanings..? :nerd::point_up:
</p>

<p>
Anyways, this is something funny happened on the first few days (I guess this is official day 1 and I ghosted because I thought it's a negative word, the next day I asked Charmaine and I later talked to Claire on Day 3?? My brain is rusting) 
</p>

<p>
The strongest feeling is that everyone here worth <i>stalking</i>. This is a very strange claim, to elaborate, people here are all very interesting and actually good at something (but they hardly talk abt this). Such a pity that my 3rd party assigned person is Dan, who is definitely not frequently online though he's always spotted with his laptop dealling with his code. Even his twitter's full of academic stuff..? The first time I saw that twitter account I was chronically scared -- how will someone actually be this <i>nerdy</i>??? Not even enjoying social media apps... So the only info I had about him is just: WPI, Pre-doc, Oxford, economics economics economics... After listening to him chitchat to someone I gained the precious info that he liked chocolate tropical :clown: to be honest if I was assigned to introduce Claire, I can start from her 2019 computer science hackerthon club, taking physics c in middle school and her 3 rsi experiences :joy:. Also due to this reason I don't know how cracked they are until I found her instagram bruhhhhhh.
</p>

<p>
However, tho everyone (except me) exceled in at least one subject/field, there's 0% of arrogance, pretenciousness, and all other things I may planned to see from anyone from these backgrounds. 
</p>


<p> 
All the JCs/counselors/instructors (I have little idea on the differences at least from what i saw its not that differentiated like ross) are nice, even though i regret i dont have the time to have one-on-one with most of them. I should copy Jack's plan, to have one-on-one with everyone. It is strange to call them "junior counselor", because I was also assigned the tag in Ross but I am not even 10% experienced compared to this camp's jcs. Among all the jcs, I should say, I "objected" Claire, Sanskriti, Janet, Yiwa (def not racially motivated attracted) and Bence the most, tho it's very hard to have very deep conversations. A lot of my one-on-ones are not actually that deep, and also from what I objected from other pairs of one-on-ones, most of them can only dive only to the depth such that "they kinda know ur life experience", and distractors "with high frictional constant" (aka ppl started talking things in these topics and cant go back to what they originally talked abt) such as yapping, jane street, college app, future career consideration prevented us from diving deeper. This is, at least, a problem for me. I sometimes feel like very deep conversations, maybe onto some philosophical topics, only depends on the luck..? Tho I should say topics considering future careers, <s>why you should not take a job in jane street</s> are also deep enough for people that I have met for only 10 days or less.
</p>

<p>
Away from those, I nominate Claire and Janet as people with the best music taste. 10000% appreciation for that. Claire is the best playlist maker I discovered from Day 1. Janet is probably the best intl chinese I ever met with the most knowledge in chinese culture. Stalking her is a rating 100/10 fun activity, I got so surprised bro has the dog comic I read in primary school as phone wallpaper?? Also tf bro even know 烟雨, this is 110% concentrated chinese orz. Somewhat somewhat I feel like bro should try to sneak into a chinese middle school and start teaching them some chem stuff in chinese would be so fun. 
</p>

<p>Also, quite surprised that Janet even listened to Tabun when she was doing bio oly??? The general traumatized music is real whenever I listened to this I think of the route to my physics class to meet S. Y. in middle school :pensive: erm bruh the delusions.</p>

<p>
Just to mention because I want praise for my first impressions accuracy, on Day 0 dinner time, I texted my friend "and there's also someone that give me the same vibe as Jocelyn I have no idea maybe shes brainrotted too cant tell now", I am now not only a 100% acc matchingmaster but also 100% acc in general guessing. 
</p>

<p>
Aside from everything satisfying, I just felt regretful only talked to a few people, should be more prepared on having intensive social activities. I WAS PROCRASTINATING ON HAVING ONE-ON-ONES WHATS WRONG WITH ME. i have been considering on having one-on-one with janet on approximately day 7 but somewhat somewhat got scared from talking to people from no where..? I am generally afraid of wasting time just talking abt "whats ur lifestory/why do u choose this major" no idea which kind of people will enjoy and I also want to escape from getting answers like "oh i was born in bay area, raised in bay area and now living in bay area", ohh what an interesting lifestory with gradient 0... or like "I have no idea why i choose this major maybe its something in my gene that motivates me to become the ultimate environmentalist/math enjoyer/oly grinder <s>automatically take take as the paraphrased version of 'it's a good approach to the t10 colleges'</s>". 
</p>

<p>
So this has been a dilemma for me: on the one hand I definitely enjoy staying with people more than just locking myself in the dorm (in general not only the suspiciously half-haunted queen's college dorm), but at the same time I am afraid of communicating. Being scared of chatting boring stuffs that waste both our times also influences me to avoid conversations in general. The best socializing approach for me may be just sitting together with someone but staring at my own laptop <s>(just realized this is ross pset mode erm no way my fav camp shaped me as introvert 10% autistic weirdo :moyai:)</s> 
</p>

<p>
But other than that, it has been great. Just read a post in social media app saying most people are just raindrops sliding fast through the life window <s>(and few are not raindrops but bird poops)</s>, I hope gravity does not exist so that they stay on my window longer; otherwise, please, please, at least splash on the window again.  
</p>
